About SVG4FNA
-------------
SVG4FNA was written for a currently unannounced project by Ethan Lee.

Dependencies
------------
SVG4FNA depends on FNA's SetDataPointerEXT extension as well as a private
variable in FNA's Effect implementation. Porting away from FNA should be easy
but is still a nonzero amount of work!
